   <li>Coyote Starrk was an Arrancar and the Primera (1st) Espada in Sosuke Aizen’s army, along with his other half, Lilynette Gingerback. Starrk is a lazy and unenthusiastic man who spends much of his time asleep, and no one, except Lilynette Gingerback, his other half, appears to try and stop him from doing so. He is so powerful millions of hollow die just by being close to him. With victories over former Captains Love and Rose without much trouble he is truly deserving of the number on spot.

He does not hesitate to impose his perceived authority over other. He is the former king of Hueco Mundo. Many consider him the true number one. Altho His arrogance was his own downfall. The man is a true powerhouse.</li>

   <li>Bambietta Basterbine is Stern Ritter E of the Vandenreich. Bambietta has the ability to turn anything that her Reishi and Reiatsu touch into a bomb. Because of this, her explosive attacks cannot be blocked. However, her attacks can be deflected before the explosion occurs, if hit by a sufficient force.
