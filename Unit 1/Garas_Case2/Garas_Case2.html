<br /><br /><br />
<p>One of the <strong>greatest areas of concern for this century</strong> is global warming. 
Although scientists and researchers have been predicting global warming 
for several decades now, much of their predictions have gone unheeded until 
the beginning of this century. The recent ferocity of storms in the Atlantic 
and the seemingly unending drought in Australia are all considered signs of 
the effects of global warming.</p>

<h3>Some Effects of Global Warming</h3>

<ol type="i">
   <li>Increased activity of Atlantic storms</li>
   <li>Drought in Australia, parts of Africa and Asia</li>
   <li>Flooding in parts of the United States and Europe</li>
   <li>Rising sea levels as polar ice melts</li>
</ol>


<h3>Fossil Fuel Reliance</h3>
<p>The implications are quite clear; unless we start to reduce emissions from <br />
all carbon-based sources, <strong>the effects of global warming could be disastrous.</strong> <br />
One solution, of course, is to begin limiting our use of fossils fuels. By <br />
switching to wind, wave, solar, and fuel cell energy-generating technologies, <br />
perhaps the effects of global warming could be reduced or even reversed.</p>

<h3>Time is Short</h3>
<p>There is, unfortunately, no one school of thought as to when the Earth might <br />
reach a point of irreversible climate change. Some scientists have speculated <br />
that <strong>serious global change could occur within the next decade</strong>; others feel that <br />
no serious changes would take effect till the end of the century. It is this <br />
latter school of thought that has led many people to take global warming as a <br />
problem to be dealt with by future generations, not this one. Dr. Saul Johnson, <br />
chief researcher at the Climatic Research and Study Institute, recently said <br />
the following:</p>
<blockquote>"This is a crucial time in our history. As polar ice caps melt, not only does<br /> 
it increase the chance of flooding along the shorelines of every coastal community, <br />
the decreased saline levels of the ocean are leading to climate change. Global <br />
warming doesn't just affect the polar regions, <strong>it affects every region of the globe, <br />
everything that lives in the sea, and everyone who sustains life from the sea.</strong>
</blockquote>

<h3>The GWC</h3>
<p>The GWC is a scientific group headed by Dr. Lars Bearrings at the Swedish <br />
Institute of Hypothermal Research. Dr. Bearrings has dedicated twenty years to <br />
this study of global warming. He takes a more moderate view on the subject. He <br />
feels that there is time to reverse the effects of climate change, but he feels <br />
that <strong>time to act is now.</strong></p>
