<p>One of the greatest areas of concern for this century is global warming. 
Although scientists and researchers have been predicting global warming 
for several decades now, much of their predictions have gone unheeded until 
the beginning of this century. The recent ferocity of storms in the Atlantic 
and the seemingly unending drought in Australia are all considered signs of 
the effects of global warming.</p>

Some Effects of Global Warming

Increased activity of Atlantic storms
Drought in Australia, parts of Africa and Asia
Flooding in parts of the United States and Europe
Rising sea levels as polar ice melts


Fossil Fuel Reliance

<p>The implications are quite clear; unless we start to reduce emissions from 
all carbon-based sources, the effects of global warming could be disastrous. 
One solution, of course, is to begin limiting our use of fossils fuels. By 
switching to wind, wave, solar, and fuel cell energy-generating technologies, 
perhaps the effects of global warming could be reduced or even reversed.</p>

Time is Short

<p>There is, unfortunately, no one school of thought as to when the Earth might 
reach a point of irreversible climate change. Some scientists have speculated 
that serious global change could occur within the next decade; others feel that 
no serious changes would take effect till the end of the century. It is this 
latter school of thought that has led many people to take global warming as a 
problem to be dealt with by future generations, not this one. Dr. Saul Johnson, 
chief researcher at the Climatic Research and Study Institute, recently said 
the following:</p>

"This is a crucial time in our history. As polar ice caps melt, not only does 
it increase the chance of flooding along the shorelines of every coastal community, 
the decreased saline levels of the ocean are leading to climate change. Global 
warming doesn't just affect the polar regions, it affects every region of the globe, 
everything that lives in the sea, and everyone who sustains life from the sea."

The GWC
<p>The GWC is a scientific group headed by Dr. Lars Bearrings at the Swedish 
Institute of Hypothermal Research. Dr. Bearrings has dedicated twenty years to 
this study of global warming. He takes a more moderate view on the subject. He 
feels that there is time to reverse the effects of climate change, but he feels 
that time to act is now.</p>
