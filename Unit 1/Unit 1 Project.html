   <h1>SKRILLEX</h1>
  
   <h2>And Why He Makes The Best EDM</h2>
   
   <hr />

   <p>Skrillex is my favorite EDM (Electronic Dance Music) maker. His music is what<br />
      brought me into mixtaping and "DJing." I was intrigued at how his music represented<br />
      human instincts and emotions without a lot of human singing. I would say that it was<br />
      like showing us how robots feel emotion. I made four songs on GarageBand, and I<br />
      would say that I was inspired by his way of making music.
