<h1>The Cover Letter</h1>

<h3>The Mechanics of the Letter</h3>
<p>It may go without saying, but the cover letter must be perfect. 
The cover letter is not intended to get you the job, it's intended 
to get your foot in the door. You can eliminate yourself from being
 considered for a job if your cover letter is nothing less than perfect.
  Proofread the letter at least three times. Have someone else proofread
   the letter, too. A second set of eyes can find mistakes that you might
    miss. Grammar and punctuation must be 100% correct. No typos, please.
     Don't rely on just the spell check feature of a word processor alone.
      <em style="color: red; font-weight: bold; text-transform: uppercase;">Proofread for meaning</em>.</p> 

<p><em><strong style="font-weight: bolder; font-size: 15px; color: red;">Paper &ndash;</strong></em> The paper must be at least 20lb paper,
 preferably a 100% cotton fiber. A more substantial paper weight of 24lb
  would be better. Choose bright white or off-white (beige). Don't choose
   a color such as red or bright yellow that will actually put off a
    potential employer. A White or a neutral color works best.</p>

<p><em><strong style="font-weight: bolder; font-size: 15px; color: red;">Font &ndash;</strong></em> Don't choose a font face that is
 hard to read, such as a fantasy font or a script font. Choose Arial
  or Times New Roman. Arial is a more modern typeface. Times New Roman
   is a more conservative type face. The more conservative the company,
    the more likely you would be to choose a serif font, like Times New
     Roman.</p>

<h3>Explain Why You are Writing to This Employer</h3>

<p>Identify your skills and accomplishments. Don't embellish. State
 the truth in simple facts. If you started a newsletter, participated
  in charity events, were the president or an officer of one or more
   clubs, or was the quarterback of the football team &ndash; just state
    what you did and why it mattered to you. All of these activities give
     you experience in leadership and working as part of a team.</p>

<h3>Tell the Employer Why You Want to Work for the Company</h3>
<p>Do some research. What makes this company so special? Is it that
 they are a start-up company and you have a special talent that will
  help them get off the ground? Is it an established company whose
   reputation and stability are the attraction? Tell the employer
    that you want to be part of that organization and that it really
     matters to you that you get the job. Don't tell them that you
      need a job &ndash; tell them how <em style="text-transform: uppercase; color: red; font-weight: bold;">their company</em> will
       benefit from hiring you.</p>

<h3>Wrap it Up</h3>

<p>Thank the reader for his or her time, and invite him or her
 to contact you. Give them your phone number(s) and email address.
  Invite the reader to contact you so that you may better explain
   in greater detail why you are qualified for the position you
    are seeking. <em style="text-transform: uppercase; color: red; font-weight: bold;">Your gain is their gain.</em></p>
