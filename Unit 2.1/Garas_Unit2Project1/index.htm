<h1>Longboards!</h1>
<hr /><br />

<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>A longboard is a type of sports equipment similar to, but not the same as, a 
skateboard. It is often longer than a skateboard and has a wide variety of shapes. It 
tends to be faster because of wheel size, construction materials and more precise 
hardware. Longboards are commonly used for cruising and downhill racing, known as 
longboarding, rather than skateboarding.</p>
<br />

<h4>History</h4>
<p>The first longboards were made by Preston Nichols in the 1940s and 50s as an 
alternative when the waves were too dull. Early skaters built dangerous, improvised boards
 out of planks of wood and roller skates in a practice known as Sidewalk Surfing. 
 Manufactured Longboards first became commercially available in 1959 when Makaha, Jack's, 
 and Hobie became the first professional longboard distributors. These early longboards 
 were still relatively crude, as they still featured metal wheels, but later had clay 
 wheels due to improved safety factors. Longboarding became a popular activity in the late
  1950s and early 1960s, but its popularity had largely died by 1965. Longboarding made a 
  comeback in 1972 when Frank Nasworthy and the Cadillac Wheel Company introduced the 
  urethane longboard wheel. Urethane wheels allowed skaters to reach very high downhill 
  speeds which were not possible before. Standard vertical kingpin skate trucks at the 
  time could not maintain stability at these speeds. In the 1990s, <a 
  href="https://www.sector9.com/" target="_blank">Sector 9</a> developed the 
  reverse kingpin skate truck. The reverse kingpin trucks stability and maneuverability 
  helped downhill longboarding grow into a legitimate sport, with the <u>International 
  Gravity Sports Association (IGSA)</u> as its governing body. The 90's also saw the 
  introduction of the cutout deck, which has sections cut out around the wheels to prevent
   the wheels from touching the board during hard turns. Longboard technology has evolved 
   rapidly to accommodate unique modern skating disciplines including downhill, slalom, 
   freeriding, dancing, and freestyle. Modern longboard decks can be made from a variety 
   of materials including fiberglass composites, aluminum, and carbon fiber. Precision 
   trucks, which are machined with cutting edge CNC technology instead of die casting 
   with molds, offer more strength and maneuverability than cast trucks and have achieved 
   popularity among professional skaters.</p><br />

<h4>Dimensions</h4>
<p>Most boards measure 84 to 150 centimeters (33 to 59 in) in length while widths vary 
from 22.8 to 25.4 cm (9.0 to 10.0 in). There are several longboard shapes, such as 
pintails, swallowtails, flat-nose riders, drop-through decks, drop decks and boards with 
the same shape as a standard skateboard. Pintails permit looser trucks and larger wheels 
which are better suited for carving or a "smooth" feel, whereas drop decks and drop 
throughs allow the rider to be closer to the ground, hence a lower center of gravity which
 increases stability and allows these boards to support more high speed downhill riding 
 disciplines. Mid-length boards, 94 to 127 cm (37 to 50 in) are the most versatile. Their 
 greater weight and bulk makes them less suitable for many skateboarding tricks, but 
 contributes to a fluid motion by providing more momentum. The longboard's design allows 
 for big turns or quick short carves similar to the motions of surfers or snowboarders. 
 Longboards have 3 axes: the tail axis (running from tail to tail), the central axis 
 (running straight down through the center of the board), and the short axis (running from
  the width of the board and perpendicular to the tail axis).</p><br />
  
<h4>Records</h4>
<p>A record for the longest distance traveled on a longboard was set by David Cornthwaite 
in 2006 when he skated 3,638.26 miles (5,855.21 km) from Perth to Brisbane across 
Australia. This record has since been broken by Rob Thomas of New Zealand, who skated 
7,555 miles (12,159 km). The land speed record on a longboard was set in 2012, when Mischo
 Erban reached a speed of 129.94 km/h (80.741 mph).</p><br />
 
<h4>Equipment and Protection</h4>
<p>The '<em>helmet culture</em>' is more prevalent in longboarding than in skateboarding. Most 
riders wear protective equipment in all disciplines, and nearly all professionals wear a 
helmet and gloves. Longboard protective equipment is similar to standard skateboard 
equipment, with the exception of slide gloves. Most longboarders wear slide gloves and 
helmets, as these are considered the bare minimum for protection. Additional protection 
includes: leathers, wrist guards, knee pads, elbow pads and sometimes spine protectors and
 padded shorts. Many professional longboarding teams and riders are required to wear and 
 advocate all aspects of protection. In the sliding and downhill disciplines, riders wear 
 "slide gloves" which are specialized gloves made out of a strong materials such as 
 leather and synthetic fabrics, and have large discs called "pucks" attached to the palms.
  These are attached to protect the hands as the rider uses them to pivot during slides 
  along the ground. The pucks are usually made of synthetic polymers: delrin, UHMW, or 
  corian.</p><br />
