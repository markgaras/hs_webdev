<h3 class="chosen">Looks Matter</h3>
<p>If your site looks amateurish, you've lost credibility with your customers. Turn off 
the blinking, flashing, scrolling, and crawling text. You're running a business Web site, 
not a carnival. Choose a readable font in a size that's easy to read. Stick to one font 
face and not more than three font sizes. It may be interesting to have 10 different font 
faces on your site, but having too many font faces tends to detract from your site, not 
enhance it. Your Web site should not look like a ransom note. Use neutral tones or colors 
that complement each other. Avoid red &mdash; 5% of the population is color blind and 
can't see it; also red is associated with danger and financial loss.</p>

<br />
<h3 class="notchosen">Title Tales</h3>
<p>No, I'm not talking about titles such as Ms. or Mrs. and the like. Search engines 
scan the title bar in their search for "hits." If your company name is "Astro Galaxy 
Unlimited" and you sell cosmetics, you might do a great job in attracting astrophysicists 
to your Web site, but you're not going to land at the top of anyone's hit list who's
 searching for cosmetics. Include meaningful words in the title, not just the company name.</p>


<h3 class="chosen">Let Your Page Inform, not Entertain</h3>
<p>Flash is a technology that places interesting animations on a Web page. Don't let your
 site have a Flash "splash page," whereby the visitor to your site has to click to first 
 get past the Flash page in order to view your home page. Put the Flash presentations on 
 your home page so that the user has a choice of whether or not to view the Flash presentation.</p>

<br /><br />
<h3 class="notchosen">Get Their Attention</h3>
<p>At the top of your page, state what your company can do for the customer. Why are you 
the best? Why should the customer use your services? What makes you so special? Why should
 the customer buy your goods or use your services? Make these reasons clear from the start 
 and at the top.</p>


<h3 class="chosen">Let's Make Contact</h3>
<p>Don't make the customer have to search for contact information. That's a great way to
 kill a sale, not create one. Make sure your contact information is easy to find. Have your 
 address, phone number, fax number, email address and link at the top and the bottom of
  every page.</p> 
  
<br />
<h3 class="notchosen">Get the Picture</h3>
<p>Photos should be the right size (not more than 3 inches by 3 inches) and not be distorted. 
Your photos should not look like a fun house mirror. Background graphics should contrast 
with, not compete with, text. If you have a lot of photos, create thumbnail images (about 
1 - 1 1/2 inches square) that link to larger-size images. Having the large images on separate
 pages means your home page will download faster. Also, pages with several large photos 
 and little text look quite "old school" and amateurish &dash; it looks as if you've got 
 nothing to say, and that's the last thing you want to convey to your readers.</p>


<h3 class="chosen">How Will You Compete?</h3>
<p>Decide early on how you will differentiate yourself from others &mdash; price, selection, 
expertise, market niche, uniqueness, speed of delivery, unique knowledge of the subject matter 
&mdash; all of these aspects are important in starting a business and staying in business.</p>
