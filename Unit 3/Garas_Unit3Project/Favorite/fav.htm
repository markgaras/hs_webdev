<p>I've always liked <span style="font-family: Zapfino, Arial, 'Times New Roman';">Charizard</span>,
from <span style="color: red;">Pokemon</span>, because his design is so simple and yet so
powerful and regal looking. He is a generation 1 Pokemon, which means he was one of the
first <span style="font-family: Futura, Arial, 'Times New Roman', Zapfino;">Pokemon</span>.
Charizard evolves from Charmeleon, who evolves from Charmander. <span style="font-size: 50%;">Charizard</span>
has two <span style="font-size: 200%;">"Mega"</span> forms (pictured left). He is a Fire/Flying type, meaning that he is great
against Grass, Ice, Bug, Fighting and Steel types, but he is weak to Rock, Water, and
Electric Types.</p>
