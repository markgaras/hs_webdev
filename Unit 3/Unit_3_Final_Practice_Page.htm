<p style="font-family: 'Apple Casual', Arial, 'Times New Roman';">&nbsp &nbsp &nbspI was
born on November 1, 2000, in El-Qantarah el-Sharqiyya, Egypt.
I moved to York in 2004, right after my sister was born. I am currently living with my mom
and dad, who are both from Egypt. My dad is from El-Qantarah el-Sharqiyya, but my mom is
from Girga, Egypt. They met around 1998, and they married in 2000. I like playing
basketball and videogames. I am 15, and I know English (obviously), Arabic, and 
I'm learning Spanish.</p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

<p style="font-family: Chalkduster, Arial, Zapfino;">&nbsp &nbsp &nbspI've always thought
that dragons were the coolest. There are so many cool possibilities of types, and THEY 
BREATHE FIRE. What else can I really say? They can have armored skin, wings, be in any
color, etc. I think that they are my favorites because of an old Japanese story of how a 
really weak fish swam up a river and turned into a dragon. I think that this is a 
beautiful story.</p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
