<p style="font-family: Arial, Futura;">&nbsp &nbsp<strong>Theodor Seuss Geisel</strong> (March 2, 1904 â€“ September 24, 1991) was an American writer and
illustrator best known for authoring popular children's books under the pen name <strong>Dr. Seuss</strong>. His
work includes several of the most popular children's books of all time, selling over 600 million
copies and being translated into more than 20 languages by the time of his death.[2]
Geisel adopted his "Dr. Seuss" pen name during his university studies at Dartmouth College and
the University of Oxford. He left Oxford in 1927 to begin his career as an illustrator
and cartoonist for <em>Vanity Fair</em>, <em>Life</em>, and various other publications. He also worked as an illustrator
for advertising campaigns, most notably for Flit and Standard Oil, and as a political cartoonist for
the New York newspaper <em>PM</em>. He published his first children's book <em>And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street</em> in 1937.
During World War II, he worked in an animation department of the United States Army where he produced several short films,
including <em>Design for Death</em>, which later won the 1947 Academy Award for Documentary Feature.[3]<br /><br />
After the war, Geisel focused on children's books, writing classics such as <em>If I Ran the Zoo (1950), Horton Hears a
Who!(1955), If I Ran the Circus (1956), The Cat in the Hat (1957), How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (1957), and Green Eggs and
Ham (1960)</em>. He published over 60 books during his career, which have spawned numerous adaptations, including 11 television
specials, four feature films, a Broadway musical, and four television series. He won the Lewis Carroll Shelf Awardin 1958
for <em>Horton Hatches the Egg</em> and again in 1961 for <em>And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street</em>. Geisel's birthday, March 2, has
been adopted as the annual date for National Read Across America Day, an initiative on reading created by the National
Education Association.</p>
